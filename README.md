If we want test with coverage

> go test ./... -test.coverprofile coverage
> go test ./... -cover


## CI/CD

CI Tool Chain For Go

For my personal code I use GitHub as a repository, so assuming that the tools
Iâ€™ll employ are:

- GitHub Actions: Automate the workflow
- Codecov.io: A coverage dashboard
- Readme badges: Easy visibility dashboard on CI status

- Templates CI/CD for golang projects
  
### CI-WORKFLOW [ ./gihub/workspaces/ci-go.yml ]

### TO DOs

- https://github.com/tj-actions/coverage-badge-go/tree/main/.github/workflows
- https://medium.com/synechron/how-to-set-up-a-test-coverage-threshold-in-go-and-github-167f69b940dc

Start with any events on

- Push:
  - On branches `main` or `feature`
- Any pull_request

```mermaid
stateDiagram
    direction LR
    [*] --> checkout@v3
    checkout@v3 --> setup_go@v3
    setup_go@v3 --> vet
    vet --> fmt
    fmt --> build
    build --> [*]
```

### LINT Golang [ ./github/workspaces/golangci-lint]

Start with

- Push:
  - On Tag with name as `v*`
  - On branches `main` or `feature`
- Any pull_request

```mermaid
stateDiagram
    direction LR
    [*] --> checkout@v3
    checkout@v3 --> golangci_lint
    golangci_lint --> [*]
```

### CD Workflow [ ./github/workspaces/release.yml ]

- Push:
  - On Tag with name as `v*`
  - On only branches `main`
- Any pull_request

```mermaid
stateDiagram
    direction LR
    [*] --> checkout@v3
    checkout@v3 --> setup_go@v3
    setup_go@v3 --> goreleaser
    goreleaser --> [*]
```
